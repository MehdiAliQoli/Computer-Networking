# Chapter 2: Layered Tasks

##  Internet Model
The **Internet Model**, also known as the **TCP/IP protocol suite**, is a layered protocol stack that dominates data communication and networking today.

### **Layers of the Internet Model:**
1. **Application Layer**  
2. **Transport Layer**  
3. **Network Layer**  
4. **Data Link Layer**  
5. **Physical Layer**  

Each layer defines a set of functions that distinguish it from other layers. Layers interact with each other using protocols, which are agreed-upon rules and conventions governing communication.

### **Peer-to-Peer Communication**
Each layer communicates with its corresponding layer on the other device (peer-to-peer communication), ensuring smooth data transfer.

## üõ†Ô∏è Functions of Layers

### **1. Physical Layer**
The physical layer coordinates the functions required to transmit a bit stream over a physical medium. It deals with the mechanical and electrical specifications of the interface and transmission media.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- **Physical Characteristics of interface and media** ‚Äì Defines hardware specifications like cables and connectors.
- **Representation of bits** ‚Äì Converts data into signals for transmission.
- **Data rate control** ‚Äì Determines the speed of data transmission.
- **Synchronization of bits** ‚Äì Ensures sender and receiver are in sync.

### **2. Data Link Layer**
Transforms the raw transmission facility provided by the physical layer into a reliable link. It establishes a reliable connection between the network and physical layers.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- **Framing** ‚Äì Divides data into manageable chunks for transmission.
- **Physical Addressing** ‚Äì Assigns unique identifiers (MAC addresses) to devices.
- **Flow Control** ‚Äì Manages data transmission speed between sender and receiver.
- **Error Control** ‚Äì Detects and corrects transmission errors.
- **Access Control** ‚Äì Determines how devices share the communication channel.

### **3. Network Layer**
Ensures the source-to-destination delivery of packets across multiple networks.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- **Logical Addressing** ‚Äì Provides unique IP addresses for devices.
- **Routing** ‚Äì Determines the optimal path for data to travel.

---

### **4. Transport Layer**
Provides process-to-process delivery of the entire message, ensuring reliability and correct sequencing.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- **Port Addressing** ‚Äì Identifies specific applications using port numbers.
- **Segmentation and Reassembly** ‚Äì Splits data into segments and reassembles them at the destination.
- **Connection Control** ‚Äì Establishes and terminates communication sessions.
- **Flow Control** ‚Äì Prevents data overflow by regulating transmission.
- **Error Control** ‚Äì Ensures reliable delivery by detecting and retransmitting lost data.

---

### **5. Application Layer**
The application layer allows the user (whether human or software) to access the network.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- **Mail Services** ‚Äì Supports email communication.
- **File Transfer and Access** ‚Äì Allows remote file sharing and access.
- **Remote Login** ‚Äì Provides access to systems over the network.
- **Access to the World Wide Web (WWW)** ‚Äì Enables web browsing and interaction.

## üìä OSI Model
The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model** consists of seven layers, providing a universal standard for data communication.

### **Layers of OSI Model:**
1. **Physical Layer** (Handles raw bit transmission)
2. **Data Link Layer** (Provides reliable data transfer)
3. **Network Layer** (Manages routing and addressing)
4. **Transport Layer** (Ensures complete data transfer)
5. **Session Layer** (Manages communication sessions)
6. **Presentation Layer** (Data translation, encryption, compression)
7. **Application Layer** (User interface and applications)
