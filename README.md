## Chapter 1: Introduction to Data Communication and Networking

### **Direction of Data Flow**

#### 1. Simplex
- Unidirectional communication.
- Example: Keyboard (data flows in one direction only).

#### 2. Half Duplex
- Both devices can transmit and receive, but not at the same time.
- Example: Walkie-talkies (communication occurs alternately).

#### 3. Full Duplex
- Both devices can transmit and receive simultaneously.
- Example: Telephones (two-way communication at the same time).

### **Network**
A network is a set of devices connected by communication links. Essential criteria for a network include:
- **Distribution of processes**
- **Performance, reliability, and security**

#### **Types of Connections:**
1. **Point-to-Point:** Direct connection between two devices.
2. **Multipoint:** Multiple devices share a single link.

---

### **Physical Topology**
Defines how a network is physically laid out. Common topologies include:
1. **Mesh Topology** - Every device connects to every other device.
2. **Star Topology** - All devices connect to a central hub.
3. **Bus Topology** - All devices share a common communication line.
4. **Ring Topology** - Each device connects to exactly two other devices forming a loop.

### **Categories of Networks**
1. **Local Area Network (LAN):** Covers a small geographical area, such as a home or office.
2. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):** Covers a city or large campus.
3. **Wide Area Network (WAN):** Covers a large geographical area, such as a country or continent.

### **Internet**
When two or more networks are connected, they form an **internetwork** or simply the **Internet.**

---

### **Protocols**
In computer networks, communication occurs between entities in different systems. An **entity** can send and receive information, but for communication to be effective, both entities must adhere to a **protocol.**

#### **What is a Protocol?**
A protocol is a set of rules governing data communication. It defines:
1. **Syntax:** The format and structure of the data.
2. **Semantics:** The meaning of each section of data and actions to be taken.
3. **Timing:** When and how fast data can be sent and received.

### **Conclusion**
Understanding data communication and networking concepts such as data flow, network topologies, and protocols is essential for building and maintaining efficient communication systems.
